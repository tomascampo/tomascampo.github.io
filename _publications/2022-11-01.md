In this undergraduate thesis, the problem of finding the symmetries of the de Sitter Universe was formulated by means of a geometrical analysis from the perspective of Riemannian geometry. Cosmology models space-time as a pseudoriemannian variety, since this allows differential geometry and preserves the causality of events. The general objective was to find the Killing vectors associated to the de Sitter Universe, so the specific objectives were to construct the Riemannian manifold to study the mathematical structure used to model space-time, to perform the de Sitter solution according to the standard model of Cosmology to know the metric of this Universe and to solve the Killing equations for this Universe with the purpose of finding the vectors associated to the symmetries.

My general research interests are Topological K-Theory, Fibre Bundles & Homotopy Theory. I co-founded the 'Semillero Estudiantil de Investigación en Física-Matemática' ([SEIFM](https://www.instagram.com/seinfismat/)) of the Universidad Pedagógica Nacional, led by Professor Sandra Ávila.

I am looking for a definition of solid in the context of Graph Theory that allows to establish isomorphisms of solids by means of algebraic isomorphisms.

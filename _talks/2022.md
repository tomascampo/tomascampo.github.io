This talk was made for the <i>SEIFM</i> members. In this talk I defined the <i>Grothendieck Group</i> with the space of equivalent complex vector bundles over a Haussdorf topological space <i>X</i>, to construct an abelian monoid with the <i>direct sum</i> as its operation, then apply the <i>Grothendieck technique</i> to transform it into an abelian group. This group works as a medium to classify <i>Vector Bundles</i> in K-Theory.
